Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) form the foundation of computer science and software development. Here’s a brief overview:

Data Structures
Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data efficiently. Common types include:

Linear Data Structures

Arrays: Fixed-size collections of elements.

Linked Lists: Elements (nodes) linked via pointers.

Stacks: LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure.

Queues: FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure.

Deques: Double-ended queues.

Non-Linear Data Structures

Trees: Hierarchical structures (e.g., Binary Trees, BST, AVL Trees).

Graphs: Nodes (vertices) connected by edges (e.g., Directed, Undirected, Weighted Graphs).

Heaps: Binary trees used for priority queues.

Hash Tables: Key-value storage for fast lookup.

Algorithms
Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. Key categories include:

Sorting Algorithms

Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort (O(n²))

Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap Sort (O(n log n))

Searching Algorithms

Linear Search (O(n))

Binary Search (O(log n))

Graph Algorithms

BFS (Breadth-First Search)

DFS (Depth-First Search)

Dijkstra’s Algorithm (Shortest Path)

Kruskal’s and Prim’s (Minimum Spanning Tree)

Dynamic Programming (DP)

Solves problems by breaking them into subproblems (e.g., Fibonacci, Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence).

Greedy Algorithms

Always picks the best immediate option (e.g., Huffman Coding, Activity Selection).

Divide and Conquer

Recursively breaks problems into smaller parts (e.g., Merge Sort, Quick Sort).

Backtracking

Used for constraint-based problems (e.g., N-Queens, Sudoku Solver).


Big O Notation
Big O notation is a mathematical notation used to describe the time complexity and space complexity of an algorithm. It helps us analyze how the runtime or space requirements of an algorithm grow as the input size increases.

1. Understanding Big O Complexity
Big O focuses on worst-case scenarios and expresses complexity in terms of n (input size).

Notation	Complexity Type	Example	Growth Rate
O(1)	Constant Time	Accessing an array element arr[i]	🔥 Fastest
O(log n)	Logarithmic Time	Binary Search	🔥 Efficient
O(n)	Linear Time	Traversing an array	⚡ Moderate
O(n log n)	Log-Linear Time	Merge Sort, Quick Sort	🟡 Slower
O(n²)	Quadratic Time	Nested loops (e.g., Bubble Sort)	🟠 Very Slow
O(2ⁿ)	Exponential Time	Fibonacci (naive recursion)	🔴 Impractical
O(n!)	Factorial Time	Traveling Salesman Problem (Brute Force)	🚨 Worst


Asymptotic Notation
Asymptotic notation is a mathematical tool used to describe the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity. It helps compare algorithms based on their growth rate as the input size (n) increases.

Types of Asymptotic Notation
There are three main types of asymptotic notation:

1️⃣ Big O Notation (O) – Worst Case
Represents the upper bound of an algorithm's running time.

It gives the worst-case time complexity.

Used to ensure an algorithm will not take longer than a certain amount of time.


Array in Data Structures
An array is a linear data structure that stores elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations.

1️⃣ Key Characteristics of Arrays
✅ Fixed Size – The size of an array is defined at the time of declaration.
✅ Index-Based Access – Elements are accessed using an index starting from 0.
✅ Efficient Retrieval – Accessing an element by index is O(1) (Constant Time).
✅ Contiguous Memory Allocation – Elements are stored in adjacent memory locations.


Linked List in Java
A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements (called nodes) are not stored in contiguous memory locations. Instead, each node stores a reference to the next node, forming a chain.

1️⃣ Types of Linked Lists
Singly Linked List (SLL) – Each node points to the next node.

Doubly Linked List (DLL) – Each node points to both next and previous nodes.

Circular Linked List (CLL) – The last node points back to the first node.

2️⃣ Node Structure
Each node contains:

Data – The actual value stored in the node.

Next – A reference (pointer) to the next node.


Stack in Java
A Stack is a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) data structure, meaning the last element added is the first one to be removed.

📌 Example of Stack Operations:

Push (Insert) → Add an item to the top.

Pop (Remove) → Remove the top item.

Peek (Top) → View the top item without removing it.

isEmpty → Check if the stack is empty.



Hash Tables in Java
A Hash Table (HashMap) is a key-value data structure that allows fast lookups, insertions, and deletions in O(1) average time complexity.

1️⃣ How Hash Tables Work
Key-Value Storage: Data is stored as key-value pairs.

Hashing: A hash function converts the key into an index.

Collision Handling: If multiple keys map to the same index, they are stored using chaining (LinkedList) or open addressing (probing).


🌳 Trees in Java
A Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has a parent and possibly multiple children. It is widely used in search, sorting, and hierarchical data representation.

1️⃣ Basic Tree Terminology
Root: The topmost node.

Parent & Child: The relationship between connected nodes.

Leaf Node: A node with no children.

Depth: Number of edges from the root to a node.

Height: The longest path from a node to a leaf.

Binary Tree: A tree where each node has at most two children.

Binary Search Tree (BST): A binary tree where the left subtree contains smaller values and the right subtree contains greater values.


🌲 Binary Search Tree (BST) in Java
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of binary tree where:

The left subtree contains values smaller than the root.

The right subtree contains values greater than the root.

Both left and right subtrees must also be BSTs.

📌 Applications of BST:
✔️ Searching & Sorting
✔️ Database Indexing
✔️ Network Routing Algorithms
✔️ Auto-suggestion Systems


🌳 Binary Tree in Java
A Binary Tree is a hierarchical data structure where each node has at most two children:

Left child

Right child

Unlike Binary Search Tree (BST), there is no specific order in a binary tree.

1️⃣ Types of Binary Trees
✔ Full Binary Tree → Every node has 0 or 2 children.
✔ Complete Binary Tree → All levels are completely filled, except possibly the last.
✔ Perfect Binary Tree → All internal nodes have two children and all leaves are at the same level.
✔ Balanced Binary Tree → The height difference between left & right subtree is at most 1.
✔ Degenerate Tree → Every node has only one child, making it behave like a Linked List.


🌳 AVL Tree in Java
An AVL Tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST) where the height difference between the left and right subtrees (balance factor) is at most 1 for every node.

✅ Why Use AVL Trees?
A normal BST can become unbalanced, making operations O(n) in the worst case.
AVL Trees keep the tree balanced, ensuring all operations remain O(log n).

1️⃣ Balance Factor
The balance factor of a node is calculated as:

Balance Factor
=
Height of Left Subtree
−
Height of Right Subtree
Balance Factor=Height of Left Subtree−Height of Right Subtree
✔ Valid AVL Tree Condition:

Balance factor must be -1, 0, or 1 for every node.

If it's outside this range, the tree performs rotations to balance itself.

2️⃣ Rotations in AVL Trees
When an insertion makes the tree unbalanced, we perform rotations:

Case	Condition	Rotation Required
Left-Left (LL)	Inserted in left subtree of left child	Right Rotation (Single)
Right-Right (RR)	Inserted in right subtree of right child	Left Rotation (Single)
Left-Right (LR)	Inserted in right subtree of left child	Left Rotation + Right Rotation (Double)
Right-Left (RL)	Inserted in left subtree of right child	Right Rotation + Left Rotation (Double)


🔥 Heaps in Java
A Heap is a complete binary tree that satisfies the heap property:

Max Heap: Parent nodes are greater than their children.

Min Heap: Parent nodes are smaller than their children.

Heaps are used in priority queues, Dijkstra's algorithm, and heapsort.

1️⃣ Types of Heaps
Heap Type	Definition
Max Heap	The largest element is at the root. Every parent node is greater than its children.
Min Heap	The smallest element is at the root. Every parent node is smaller than its children.


🔥 Tries (Prefix Trees) in Java
1️⃣ What is a Trie?
A Trie (also called a Prefix Tree) is a special type of tree-based data structure used for storing and searching strings efficiently.

It is mostly used for autocomplete, spell-checking, and dictionary implementations.

Each node represents a character and has multiple children.

2️⃣ Trie Structure
Each node contains:

A character (except the root, which is empty).

Children (pointers to the next characters).

A boolean flag to mark the end of a word.



🔥 Graph Data Structure in Java
1️⃣ What is a Graph?
A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

Directed Graph: Edges have a direction (A → B).

Undirected Graph: Edges are bidirectional (A ↔ B).

Weighted Graph: Edges have weights (costs).

Unweighted Graph: All edges have equal weight.

2️⃣ Graph Representation
1. Adjacency Matrix
A 2D array where matrix[i][j] = 1 if an edge exists.

Space complexity: O(V²)

Best for dense graphs.

2. Adjacency List (Efficient)
Each vertex has a list of connected vertices.

Space complexity: O(V + E)

Best for sparse graphs.



🔥 Implementing an Undirected Graph in Java
An undirected graph is a graph where edges have no direction—connections between nodes are bidirectional.

1️⃣ Representation of an Undirected Graph
The Adjacency List is the most efficient way to represent a graph.
Each node (vertex) has a list of connected nodes (edges).




🔥 Sorting Algorithms in Java
Sorting is a fundamental operation in computer science. Here, we will cover the most common sorting algorithms with their implementations in Java.

1️⃣ Types of Sorting Algorithms
Sorting algorithms can be classified as:

🔹 Comparison-based Sorts
✔ Bubble Sort – O(n²)
✔ Selection Sort – O(n²)
✔ Insertion Sort – O(n²)
✔ Merge Sort – O(n log n)
✔ Quick Sort – O(n log n)
✔ Heap Sort – O(n log n)

🔹 Non-Comparison Sorts
✔ Counting Sort – O(n + k)
✔ Radix Sort – O(nk)
✔ Bucket Sort – O(n²)

🛠 Choosing the Best Sorting Algorithm

Merge Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	✅	Large datasets
Quick Sort	O(n log n)	O(n²)	❌	General use case
Heap Sort	O(n log n)	O(n log n)	❌	Priority queues
Counting Sort	O(n + k)	O(n + k)	✅	Small range integers
Radix Sort	O(nk)	O(nk)	✅	Large numbers
